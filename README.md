# Particle-collisions

Physics-based program designed to simulate the motion 
of random-sized particles in a two-dimensional space. This project focuses on modeling realistic
physical interactions between particles, such as movement and collisions, by 
utilizing the principles of classical mechanics. The simulation is built in Java 
and is designed to be both efficient and easy to expand, making it suitable for 
educational purposes, prototyping, or further development.
